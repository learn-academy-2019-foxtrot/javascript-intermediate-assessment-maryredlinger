3. Why is testing important?

  Your answer: It helps code have less bugs

Software testing is now a key component of software product development because it improves consistency and performance.



4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I learned that breaks are very beneficial for me and my partner. Also having another pair of eyes come look at our code and point out our syntax errors ðŸ™ˆ I also learned more about paired programming and sharing roles 



### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

  Your answer: type="text/css"

  Researched answer: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">



2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

  Your answer: a div acts as a container while a span is used for images

  Researched answer: Both <div> and <span> is used to define parts of a web page. The <span> element shows the inline portion of a document. The <div> elements show a block-level portion of a document.




3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

  Your answer: A CSS class is the name of the specific details you want to call on when styling your html.  id overides class when called in the same element or div. 

  Researched answer: Definition and Usage. The . class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.

IDs are usually used when you need to reference that element in JavaScript, so if you were looking to fade out a div when a button is clicked the div and button would get IDs instead of classes. So I use IDs for reference and classes for styling ... most of the time.




4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

  Your answer: <form> <main> <element> <footer> <header>

  Researched answer: article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, main, mark, nav, section, summary, time

  Your answer: A front end developer works on the layout of the website and how it will display to the user. Some front end softwares are CSS and HTML. They will be more skilled/ interested in the design sign rather than logic

  Researched answer: Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data. 



2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: block scope is everything inside a set of braces


3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

  Your answer: Classes are passed and this.state is passed in React to other classes
